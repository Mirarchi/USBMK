An Android USB HID Emulator

Built on top of a MAUI application with Android only deployment, this app allows to turn your android device in a physical wired keyboard and mouse device. This uses the advanced kernel capabilities to make the required USB gadgets to turn the Android device in a keyboard/mouse combo device.
To do this, your Android device MUST BE ROOTED.

This is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL and can cause unexpected reboots on your android device.

For now the only keymap that is working is the standard US/UK keyboard.

This was tested with the 'Unexpected Keyboard' app on Android 11 (Android 14 should also be ok, Android 10, at least in emulator, is not working).
